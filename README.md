# SleepyWifi
This Android app brings back the 'turn wifi off when the phone is in sleepmode' option for Android 8.1 or higher.
After you have opened the app the apps service runs in the background. The app works for Android devices with version 8.0 or higher.

## Why this app?
Google has removed the 'turn wifi off when the phone is in sleepmode' options in Android 8.1 and I was a fan of that option so I thought: 'Why don't I make that option in an android app for android 8.1 or newer devices'.

### This app does NOT work on Android 10 or higher!!!
