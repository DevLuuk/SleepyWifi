# SleepyWifi
This Android app brings back the 'turn wifi off when the phone is in sleepmode' option for Android 8.1.
The app runs in the background and autostart when android starts. The app works for Android devices with version 8.0 or higher.

## Why this app?
Google has removed the 'turn wifi off when the phone is in sleepmode' options in Android 8.1 and I was a fan of that option so I thought: 'Why don't I make that option in an android app for android 8.1 devices'.

## How to install?
 1. Download on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.devluuk.sleepywifi)
 2. Download `.apk` from [Github](https://github.com/DevLuuk/SleepyWifi/releases)
