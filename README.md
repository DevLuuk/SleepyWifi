# SleepyWifi
This Android app brings back the 'turn wifi off when the phone is in sleepmode' option for Android 8.1.
This app works for Android devices with version 8.0 or higher.

## Why this app?
Google has removed the 'turn wifi off when the phone is in sleepmode' options in Android 8.1 and i was a fan of that option so I thought: 'Why don't I make that function in an app for my phone?'.
